              Cancer diagnosis not only takes a physical toll but also impacts
              emotional and psychological well-being. Patients often feel
              isolated, struggling to find people who truly understand their
              experiences. Research shows that long-term social isolation may
              increase the risk of mental illness, reduce patient compliance
              with treatment, and increase cancer care costs Existing online
              resources lack a sense of genuine connection and community,
              leaving patients and caregivers yearning for a more personalized
              and supportive platform.
